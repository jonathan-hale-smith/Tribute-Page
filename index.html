    <ul>
      <li>April 26, 1785 - Birth of Jean Rabin in Haiti, which was then a French Colony. Father was a Navy General.</li>
      <li>January 18, 1787 - Lucy Blakewell is born in England to a wealthy family</li>
      <li>1808 - Jean Rabin (now known by John James Audubon) and Lucy Blakewell are married</li>
      <li>1808 ->  1826 - James leads the family through a series of failed business ventures, saved only by his wife's business acumen and teaching skills</li>
      <li>1826 - James heads to England, finally selling his drawings of American birds and launching his fame as a leading ornithologist.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now I understand this is a brief overview of this amazing American story, I encourage further reading on James' Wikipedia article <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_James_Audubon" target="_blank">here</a> and this lovely piece about Lucy specifically <a id="tribute-link" href="http://www.womenhistoryblog.com/2015/09/lucy-bakewell-audubon.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Even better yet, sit back and enjoy a wonderful performance by Kelly O'Connel Brengelmen who masterfully portrays Lucy in a historical monologue <a id="tribute-link" href="https://www.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/ket-ky-chautauqua-103/lucy-bakewell-audubon/support-materials/" target="_blank">here</a></p>

      In conclusion, every time you look up and see a birdie I hope you will remember that without Lucy Blakewell's supreme awesomeness, Sir John James Audubon would likely have continued to fail at everything until he starved to death and died of consumption or some shit.
